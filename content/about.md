# About VertiRhizae

Welcome to **VertiRhizae**, a dynamic platform project at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) exploring the role of **mycorrhizae in vertical farming systems**.

This page gives you a bit more context on our goals, vision, and team.  
We aim to combine open science, ecological knowledge, and innovative growing systems to rethink how crops and microbes interact in controlled environments.
